# Fuzzy-Logic-Fire-Detection-System
Prototype of Fuzzy Logic based fire detection system


Team project to create prototype fire detection system using fuzzy logic.

Mamdani Model was used.

12 Rules were defined in order to create a prototype of the fire detection system. This is nowehere even close to the amount of rules needed to have a complete system. However for the purposes of the prototype, 12 rules is enough to simulate and record a few different key test cases.
